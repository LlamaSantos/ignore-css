Ignore CSS
==========

Ignore CSS requires server side. This library is used to blend client and server side code by ignoring CSS requires when using webpack. Currently the only way to require CSS files is to place them into the render method of a component. This is an attempt to push that further up so that CSS can be combined at an earlier stage.
